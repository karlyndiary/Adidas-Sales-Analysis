### Adidas Sales Dashboard

- **Product Sales Performance**: The retailer's product portfolio comprises six categories, with men’s street footwear leading in total sales at $27,680,769, significantly surpassing women’s street footwear at $17,201,563. Conversely, women’s athletic footwear has the lowest sales, amounting to $14,315,521, followed closely by men’s athletic footwear at $20,577,180.

- **Top Retailers by Sales and Profit**: West Gear emerges as the leading retailer, recording the highest sales at $32,409,558 and profit at $121,196,890. In contrast, Amazon shows the lowest performance, with sales and profit figures at $10,096,987 and $3,984,432, respectively.

- **Monthly Sales Trends**: July marks the peak month with sales of $12,550,419 and profits of $4,780,283. Conversely, March experiences the lowest performance, with sales at $7,694,984 and profit at $2,946,398, suggesting seasonal fluctuations in consumer demand.

- **Yearly Growth and Regional Distribution**: 2021 experienced a significant 324% growth compared to the previous year, with the West region contributing the largest share of sales at 30%, followed by the Northeast at 21%. The Midwest region trails with a 14% share. Notably, online sales accounted for 41% of the overall total, reflecting a sharp increase in digital commerce, with outlet stores following at 32%.

- **Pricing Insights**: The highest-priced item, at $60, sold 1,275 units, while the lowest-priced item, at $7, saw a modest sale of 83 units, possibly reflecting lower popularity or smaller-sized items. The $30–$60 price range appears to be the optimal pricing zone, with robust sales volume observed. As prices increase beyond this range, a decline in unit sales is evident.

- **Average Monthly Units Sold**: August recorded the highest average units sold at 302, with July and September close behind at 283 and 277 units, respectively. November, however, saw the lowest unit sales at 219, potentially reflecting seasonal demand for sports and streetwear during warmer months as customers prepare for outdoor activities.

- **Sales by Location**: New York generates the highest sales at $60,000, followed by Florida at $41,000, while Maryland reports the lowest at $1,500. This geographical spread highlights regional demand variations across the retailer's markets.

# Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided : 

- **Expanding Product Offerings**: Given the strong performance of women’s apparel compared to athletic and street footwear, consider expanding the range of non-sport-specific items to further capture demand. In contrast, for men’s categories, focusing on athletic and street footwear could enhance sales and align with customer preferences.
- **Seasonal Product Alignment**: Sales trends indicate higher demand during warmer months (June, July, and August) as compared to colder months (January, February, and March). To leverage these seasonal patterns, it would be beneficial to adjust product offerings accordingly, prioritizing warm-weather apparel during summer months and winter-specific items during colder months.
- **Incentives for In-Store Purchases**: Offering tailored discounts and promotions for in-store purchases can drive foot traffic and increase sales within physical locations. For instance, implementing a program where online customers receive a voucher or discount on their next in-store purchase could encourage store visits. Additionally, offering seasonal items as complimentary incentives for meeting a purchase threshold may further stimulate in-store shopping.
